# RESTful API Best Practices ðŸ“˜

This document outlines a set of pragmatic bestâ€‘practices for designing developerâ€‘friendly, maintainable, and efficient RESTful APIs.

---

## ðŸ“Œ API Design Philosophy

- Your API is a **developer-facing UI** â€” make it intuitive, consistent, and pleasant to use.  
- Use **web standards where they make sense**, balancing simplicity, clarity, and efficiency.

---

## 1. Resource Modeling & URL Design

- Use HTTP methods semantically with nouns as resources:
  - `GET /tickets`, `GET /tickets/12`
  - `POST /tickets`, `PUT`/`PATCH /tickets/12`, `DELETE /tickets/12`  
- Always use **plural resource names** (even for single item endpoints).
- Design nested routes for tightly scoped relations (e.g. `/tickets/12/messages/5`), or embed if commonly requested.

---

## 2. Security: SSL & Authentication

- Enforce **SSL everywhere**; fail hard on HTTP (no redirects).  
- Use **stateless authentication** â€” basic token-over-Basic-Auth or OAuth 2 with Bearer tokens. For JSONP legacy clients, support queryâ€‘param tokens.

---

## 3. Versioning Strategy

- Version your API via the URL (`/v1/...`) to support browser exploration.
- Consider date-based sub-versions via headers (Stripeâ€‘style) to enable controlled evolution.

---

## 4. Input & Output Formats

- Use **JSON exclusively by default**; support XML only if needed and via URL extensions (.xml/.json).  
- Request bodies for `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH` must be JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`; otherwise return `415 Unsupported Media Type`.  
- Prefer **snake_case** (!) over camelCase for improved readability in APIs.

---

## 5. Filtering, Sorting, Searching & Pagination

- Use query params for filtering (`?state=open`), sorting (`?sort=-priority,created_at`), and searching (`?q=keyword`).  
- Allow field selection via `?fields=id,subject,updated_at` to reduce payload size.
- Support embedding related resources via `?embed=customer,assigned_user`.  
- Use **HTTP Link headers** for pagination (`rel="next"`, `rel="last"`) and optionally `X-Total-Count` for total count.

---

## 6. Response Behavior & Formatting

- For `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`, return the **new or updated resource representation**, plus:
  - `201 Created` with `Location` header on resource creation
  - `200 OK` if no creation occurred  
- Pretty-print JSON by default, with **gzip compression** enabled to minimize overhead.  
- Avoid JSON envelopes by default; use them only when needed (e.g. JSONP or header-inaccessible clients).

---

## 7. Method Override Support

- For legacy clients that support only GET/POST, allow `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header to simulate `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`.

---

## 8. Rate Limiting & Throttling

- Use **HTTP 429 Too Many Requests** when limits are exceeded.
- Include rateâ€‘limit headers:
  - `X-Rate-Limit-Limit`
  - `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining`
  - `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` (seconds until reset, not timestamp)

---

## 9. Caching

- Use `ETag` and/or `Last-Modified` headers to support conditional `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since` requests.
- Return `304 Not Modified` when appropriate.

---

## 10. Error Handling

- Return **clear, structured JSON error payloads**:
  ```json
  {
    "code": 1234,
    "message": "Validation Failed",
    "errors": [
      {
        "code": 5432,
        "field": "first_name",
        "message": "First name cannot have fancy characters"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes:
  - `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `405`, `410`, `415`, `422`, `429`, etc.

---

## 11. Developer Experience & Documentation

- Make docs publicly accessible and searchable (avoid hidden PDFs).
- Include full curl/browser requestâ€‘response examples and embedable snippets.
- Maintain a changelog or mailingâ€‘list updates for deprecation notices and version changes.
